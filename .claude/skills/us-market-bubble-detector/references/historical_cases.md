## Dotcom Bubble (1995-2000)

### Timeline

**1995-1997: Displacement (Trigger)**
- Netscape IPO (August 1995): More than doubled on first day
- Internet penetration: US 5% → 20%
- Legitimate technological innovation and investment opportunities

**1998-Early 1999: Boom (Expansion)**
- NASDAQ 100: Sustained +40% annual growth
- Adding ".com" to name alone drove stock prices up ("the .com effect")
- IPO first-day returns averaged +70%

**Late 1999-March 2000: Euphoria (Exuberance)**
- "Old Economy vs New Economy" binary opposition
- "Clicks vs Bricks" (online is invincible)
- Valuation metrics ignored: "P/E is outdated"

**March 10, 2000: Peak (NASDAQ 5,048.62)**

**March 2000-October 2002: Panic & Crash**
- NASDAQ: -78% (5,048 → 1,114)
- Many bankruptcies: Pets.com, Webvan, eToys, etc.

### Bubble-O-Meter Score Estimate (March 2000)

| Indicator | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Mass Penetration | 2 | Family/friends entering "day trading" |
| Media Saturation | 2 | Time magazine cover "Amazon.com", CNBC ratings surge |
| New Entrants | 2 | Online brokerage accounts +300% YoY |
| Issuance Flood | 2 | 457 IPOs (1999), many low-quality |
| Leverage | 1 | Margin trading increased, but not to mortgage levels |
| Price Acceleration | 2 | NASDAQ +85% annual (1999) |
| Valuation Disconnect | 2 | "Profits unnecessary, only revenue growth matters" |
| Correlation & Breadth | 2 | Even unprofitable companies rallying, no quality selection |

**Total: 15/16 points (Critical Zone)**

### Lessons

1. **The Magic of the ".com" Suffix**
   Name change alone drove +50%+ stock price gains (e.g., Zapata → Zap.com)

2. **IPO Mania Danger**
   First-day returns of +100%+ becoming normal = abnormal demand overheating

3. **"Growth Without Profits" Limits**
   Many "Get Big Fast" strategies failed, ignoring cash flow consequences

4. **Fed Rate Hikes as Trigger**
   Consecutive rate hikes 1999-2000 → funding cost rise → valuation justification impossible

## Crypto Bubble (2017)

### Timeline

**2016-Early 2017: Displacement & Boom**
- Bitcoin: $1,000 → $3,000 (June 2017)
- Emergence of ICO (Initial Coin Offering)
- Rise of altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple

**August-November 2017: Accelerating Boom**
- Bitcoin: $3,000 → $10,000
- Coinbase app #1 on US App Store
- "Blockchain revolution" narrative spreads

**December 2017: Euphoria Peak**
- Bitcoin: $10,000 → $19,783 (December 17 peak)
- **Taxi drivers preaching crypto** (iconic episode from text)
- University lectures producing "instant experts"
- Family gatherings dominated by investment talk

**December 18, 2017-December 2018: Crash**
- Bitcoin: $19,783 → $3,200 (-84%)
- ICO scams exposed, regulatory crackdown

### Bubble-O-Meter Score Estimate (Mid-December 2017)

| Indicator | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Mass Penetration | 2 | Taxi drivers, grandparents asserting "must buy" |
| Media Saturation | 2 | Google searches for "Bitcoin" at all-time high, daily CNBC specials |
| New Entrants | 2 | Coinbase new accounts exceeding 300k/day |
| Issuance Flood | 2 | 966 ICOs (2017), majority fraudulent |
| Leverage | 2 | 100x leverage trading on BitMEX etc. surging |
| Price Acceleration | 2 | Doubled in one month ($10k→$20k), acceleration positive and increasing |
| Valuation Disconnect | 2 | "Digital gold," "end of fiat currency" narratives dominant |
| Correlation & Breadth | 2 | Even obscure altcoins +1000%+ |

**Total: 16/16 points (Critical Zone - Perfect Score)**

### Lessons

1. **"Most Dangerous Phase: Rapid Rise After Selling"**
   Example from text: Took profit at $8k→$13k → 10 days later approaching $20k → regret and re-entry impulse

2. **Leverage Destructive Power**
   100x leverage = total loss on 5% adverse move, liquidation cascade accelerates crash

3. **ICO Scam Proliferation**
   Raised billions with only whitepapers → many absconded

4. **Regulatory Risk Underestimation**
   "Impossible to regulate" narrative → collapse when China/Korea closed exchanges

## Pandemic Bubble (2020-2021)

### Timeline

**March-June 2020: Displacement**
- COVID-19 panic → historic monetary easing
- Fed asset purchases, zero rates, fiscal support
- "TINA" (There Is No Alternative): No investment alternative to stocks

**July 2020-Early 2021: Boom**
- NASDAQ 100: +50% (2020 full year)
- Work-from-home/DX stocks lead (Zoom, Peloton, Shopify)
- Robinhood account openings surge, "Stonks" meme culture

**Early 2021: Euphoria**
- Meme stocks (GME, AMC) wild swings
- SPAC boom (Q1 2021: 298 formations)
- NFT mania (Beeple artwork $69M, "Bored Ape" etc.)
- Crypto resurgence (BTC $64k, "DeFi Summer")

**November 2021: Peak (NASDAQ 16,057)**

**2022: Reversal**
- Fed hawkish pivot (inflation response)
- Interest rate rises → growth stock plunge
- NASDAQ: -33% (2022 full year)
- Crypto bubble collapse (Luna, FTX failures)

### Bubble-O-Meter Score Estimate (November 2021)

| Indicator | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Mass Penetration | 2 | WallStreetBets, TikTok investment influencers proliferating |
| Media Saturation | 2 | CNBC ratings surge, housewife investment specials |
| New Entrants | 2 | Young demographic accounts 3x on Robinhood etc. |
| Issuance Flood | 2 | 613 SPACs (2021 full year), many low-quality |
| Leverage | 1 | Individual options trading surged, but not excessive mortgage levels |
| Price Acceleration | 2 | Numerous growth stocks +100%+ annual |
| Valuation Disconnect | 2 | Extreme DCF assuming "zero discount rate," profit ignored |
| Correlation & Breadth | 1 | Concentrated in FAANG etc., not broad rally |

**Total: 14/16 points (Critical Zone)**

### Special Factors

1. **Composite Bubble**
   Stocks, crypto, NFTs, SPACs simultaneously erupting, capital swirling

2. **Memeification**
   Investment decisions shift from "fundamentals" to "memes" and "community" (GME, DOGE)

3. **Zero-Rate Side Effects**
   "Risk-free rate = 0" → illusion that theoretical price of all assets approaches ∞

### Lessons

1. **End of Monetary Easing = Bubble Collapse Trigger**
   Reversal moment Fed turned hawkish (November 2021)

2. **Multi-Asset Simultaneous Bubbles Amplify Danger**
   Correlation approaches 1.0 → diversification benefit vanishes

3. **Meme Investment Limits**
   Short-term crowd frenzy unsustainable, fundamental reversion inevitable

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Trigger Always "Monetary Policy Shift"

| Bubble | Peak Timing | Policy Shift | Time Lag |
|--------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Dotcom | March 2000 | Fed rate hikes (1999-2000) | Immediate |
| Crypto 2017 | December 2017 | China regulatory crackdown | 1 month |
| Pandemic | November 2021 | Fed hawkish signal | Immediate |

### Pattern 2: Bubble Stage Time Allocation

```
Typical Bubble Cycle (total 18-36 months):
Displacement:   20% of duration (tech innovation, policy change)
Boom:           40% of duration (rational expansion)
Euphoria:       30% of duration (exuberance)
Profit Taking:  5% of duration (caution period)
Panic:          5% of duration (crash)
```

**Important:** Euphoria occupies 1/3 of total = source of "lasts too long" impression

### Pattern 3: Staged Social Penetration Expansion

```
Phase 1: Experts, early adopters (institutional investors, tech enthusiasts)
    ↓ 1-2 years
Phase 2: Educated class, white-collar workers (doctors, lawyers, salarymen)
    ↓ 6-12 months
Phase 3: General public (taxi drivers, housewives, students)
    ↓ 1-3 months
Peak reached
```

**Lesson:** When Phase 3 detected, 1-3 months remaining

### Pattern 4: Media Role

**Boom Period:**
- Cautiously optimistic "expert views"
- Risks also mentioned

**Euphoria Period:**
- FOMO incitement: "Don't miss out"
- Over-exposure of success stories
- Risk warners labeled "outdated"

**Panic Period:**
- Flip to pessimism
- "Who's to blame" witch hunt

### Pattern 5: Price Patterns

**Uptrend:**
```
Stage 1: Gradual rise (+15-25% annual)
Stage 2: Acceleration (+40-60% annual)
Stage 3: Parabolic (100%+ in months)
         ↑ Public entry here
```

**Downtrend:**
```
Stage 1: Correction (-10-15%) → "buying opportunity" perception
Stage 2: Failed bounce, double top forms
Stage 3: Collapse (-50%+) → Panic
```

### Pattern 6: "This Time Is Different" Excuse Patterns

| Bubble | "This Time Is Different" Reason | Reality |
|--------|--------------------------------|---------|
| Dotcom | Internet revolution, Old Economy over | Growth without profits unsustainable |
| Housing 2008 | Housing prices never fall, securitization spreads risk | Subprime collapse |
| Crypto 2017 | End of fiat, governments can't regulate | Regulatory crackdown causes crash |
| Pandemic | Infinite QE, perpetual zero rates, no inflation | Inflation surge → tightening |

**Lesson:** When "this time is different" becomes the mantra, historical repetition is near

## Application to Practice

### Case Study: Ideal Response During 2017 Crypto Bubble

**Premise:** Purchased Bitcoin in January 2017 at $1k with $1,000

**Actual Price Progression:**
- June: $3k (+200%)
- August: $5k (+400%)
- November: $10k (+900%)
- December 17: $19.8k (+1,880%, peak)
- December 2018: $3.2k (-84% from peak)

#### Scenario A: "Perfect Timing" Illusion (Impossible to Execute)

Sell everything at $19.8k = $19,800 profit

**Problem:** Cannot predict peak in advance, pure luck

#### Scenario B: Stair-Step Profit-Taking (Executable)

```
$3k   → Sell 25% = $750 (remaining $2,250 invested)
$5k   → Sell 25% = $1,250 (remaining $1,500 invested)
$10k  → Sell 25% = $2,500 (remaining $750 invested)
$15k  → Sell 25% = $3,750 (position fully closed)
```

**Total Profit:** $8,250
**vs Peak:** 42% (less than half of perfect)
**But:** Reliably executable, psychologically stable

#### Scenario C: ATR Trailing Stop (Executable + Upside Capture)

- Early December 2017, ATR (20-day) ≈ $1,500
- Using coefficient 1.5: Stop = $10,000 - ($1,500 × 1.5) = $7,750
- December 17 peak $19,800 → Stop updated: $19,800 - $2,250 = $17,550
- Decline starts → Sell all at $17,550

**Total Profit:** $16,550 (-11% from peak exit)
**Benefits:** Maximum upside capture, early decline exit

### Integrated Lessons

1. **Abandon "Perfection"**
   Peak selling impossible. Aim for "satisfaction" with stair-step profit-taking

2. **Mechanical Rule Superiority**
   ATR trailing eliminates emotion, exits early in bubble collapse

3. **Flexibility by Bubble Stage**
   - Boom period: Stair-step profit-taking (conservative)
   - Euphoria period: ATR trailing (aggressive)
   - Panic signs: Immediate exit (defensive)

4. **Managing Post-Hoc Regret**
   Evaluation criterion: "secure profit capture" not "could have made more"
