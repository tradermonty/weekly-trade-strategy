# Chart 1: S&P 500 Breadth Index (200-Day MA Based)

## Current Readings

**Date of Latest Data**: [Latest date visible on chart]

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Current Value | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| 8-Day MA (Orange) | [X.XX / XX%] | [Above/Below/At threshold] |
| 200-Day MA (Green) | [X.XX / XX%] | [Above/Below/At threshold] |
| Distance from 73% Peak Threshold | [+/- XX%] | [Overheated / Normal / Oversold] |
| Distance from 23% Trough Threshold | [+/- XX%] | [Extreme Oversold / Normal / Elevated] |

### Trend Direction

- **8MA Slope**: [Rising / Falling / Flat] - [Brief description of trajectory]
- **200MA Slope**: [Rising / Falling / Flat] - [Brief description of trajectory]
- **Trend Alignment**: [Both Rising / Both Falling / Diverging / Mixed]

### Latest Data Point Trend Analysis (CRITICAL)

**Focus: Rightmost 3-5 Data Points**

**8MA Recent Trajectory** (Week-by-Week from trough/recent period to present):
- **Current Level** (Week 0): [XX%]
- **1 Week Ago** (Week -1): [XX%] - Change: [+/-XX%]
- **2 Weeks Ago** (Week -2): [XX%] - Change: [+/-XX%]
- **3 Weeks Ago** (Week -3): [XX%] - Change: [+/-XX%]

**Consecutive Period Analysis**:
- Consecutive Increases: [X periods]
- Consecutive Decreases: [X periods]
- Current Momentum: [Accelerating Up / Steady Up / Decelerating / Turning Down / Falling]

**CURRENT Slope Determination** (based on latest edge):
- [ ] Rising: Latest value higher than previous 2-3 points with upward curvature
- [ ] Falling: Latest value lower than previous 2-3 points with downward curvature
- [ ] Flat: Latest value approximately equal to previous points (±2-3%)

**Failed Reversal Check** (if trough recently formed):
- [ ] Has 8MA rolled over after initial bounce?
- [ ] Has 8MA declined for 1-2+ consecutive periods after rising?
- [ ] Has 8MA failed to reach 55-60% before turning down?

**Conclusion**: The 8MA is [CURRENTLY RISING / CURRENTLY FALLING / FLAT] based on the rightmost data points.

## Signal Status

### Recent Signal Markers

**8MA Troughs (Purple ▼)**:
- Most Recent: [Date] at [XX%]
- Status: [X days/weeks since trough]
- Reversal Confirmed: [Yes / No / Developing]

**200MA Troughs (Blue ▼)**:
- Most Recent: [Date] at [XX%]
- Significance: [Major cycle low / Historical context]

**200MA Peaks (Red ▲)**:
- Most Recent: [Date] at [XX%]
- Status: [X days/weeks since peak]
- Implications: [Exit signal active / Historical peak]

### Active Signals

**Current Strategy Signal**: [CONFIRMED BUY / DEVELOPING BUY / FAILED REVERSAL / SELL / HOLD / WAIT]

**Signal Classification**:
- **CONFIRMED BUY**: Trough formed + 2-3 consecutive increases + CURRENTLY rising → ENTER LONG
- **DEVELOPING BUY**: Trough formed + < 2 consecutive increases → WAIT, MONITOR
- **FAILED REVERSAL**: Trough formed + initially rose + now declining → DO NOT ENTER
- **SELL**: 200MA peak formed → EXIT LONG
- **HOLD**: Already long, no exit signal → MAINTAIN POSITION
- **WAIT**: No trough, or waiting for new trough after failed reversal → STAY FLAT
